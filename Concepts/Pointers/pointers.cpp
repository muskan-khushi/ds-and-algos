 * Pointers in C++
 * A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

 * Reference Operator (&)
 * The reference operator (&) is used to get the memory address of a variable.
 * When you apply the reference operator to a variable, it returns the address where that variable is stored.

 * The dereference operator (*) is used to access the value stored at the memory address a pointer is holding.
 * When you apply the dereference operator to a pointer, it gives you the value at the memory address the pointer is pointing to.
