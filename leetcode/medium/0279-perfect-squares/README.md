# Perfect Squares

## Problem

Given an integer `n`, return  *the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to*  `n`.

A  **perfect square**  is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 104

        vector<int> dp(n+1, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i=1; i<=n; i++){
            for (int j=1; j*j<=i; j++){
                int square = j*j;
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-square]+1);
            }
        }

        return dp[n];

    }
};
```
